# This will assist in setting up Flask App on Nginx With Gunicorn on VPS
# This config also setups for domain names and ssl

# ANYTHING WITH A * AFTER IT, IS INTENDED FOR YOU TO EDIT FOR YOUR OWN USES
# FOR EXAMPLE: User=user_name_you_want_to_be* SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH THE USER YOU USE FOR THAT PROJECT

# ANYTHING AFER A # SYMBOL IS A COMMENT AND NOT INTENDED TO BE ADDED TO YOUR CONF FILES, IT MIGHT ERROR!


# THE IDEA IS TO COPY AND PASTE THE COMMANDS, AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS
# THERE ARE ADDITIONAL FILES ADDED TO THIS REPO YOU WILL NEED TO ADD, THEY'RE NOT IN THIS FILE/GUIDE


# DO NOT USE THE CONF FOUND FROM THESE URLS IT WON'T WORK!!!
# USE THE CONFS IN REPO, JUST USE URLS FOR REFERENCE!!!

# don't forget to add USER before doing this with the adduser command!

cd /home
python3.6 -m venv app
mkdir app/templates


source app/bin/activate
#pip installs just use pip in venv
pip install wheel flask gunicorn
# Extensions
pip install flask_login flask_mail Flask-PyMongo flask

#add app.py file, test
# should run on public_ip:port
# If it works, do WSGI

# add wsgi.py to app/

gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 wsgi:app


#Next, let’s create the systemd service unit file.
#Creating a systemd unit file will allow Ubuntu’s init system to automatically
#start Gunicorn and serve the Flask application whenever the server boots.
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/myproject.service

# put this inside
[Unit]
Description=Gunicorn instance to serve app
After=network.target

[Service]
User=user_name_you_want_to_be*
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/user_name_you_want_to_be/app  *
Environment="PATH=/home/user_name_you_want_to_be/app/bin/gunicorn"   *
ExecStart=/home/user_name_you_want_to_be/app/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:app.sock -m 007 wsgi:app   *

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
# end of

#We can now start the Gunicorn service we created and enable it so that it starts at boot:
sudo systemctl start myproject;
sudo systemctl enable myproject;

# if that worked, you'll get This
# Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/app.service → /etc/systemd/system/app.service.


# now let's add nginx confs so default web traffic is Flask

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/app

# create symlink
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/app /etc/nginx/sites-available

## SSL Setup ##
###############
# Next we need to do ssl
sudo apt install python-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d your_domain -d www.your_domain  *

# Boom, now you have flask, redirect, and ssl
