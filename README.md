# Flask_site_reference
I made a website running on flask, I use this as a reference when building new ones from scratch

You might find this helpful, but this was mostly intended for myself. I do try to leave comments to help other people
understand what's going on and why. But if you're brand new to flask, this isn't for you. This assumes you've built
a website using flask before and just need something to reference in case you forgot something
